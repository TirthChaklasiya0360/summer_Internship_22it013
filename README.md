4th sem summer internship.
Welcome to my Github repository for the summer internship 2024. This showcase the work done during the internship.

## Week-1

### Day 1: Project Setup
Tasks:
Create Project Directory:

Create a new directory for your project.
Initialize a new Git repository.
Set Up Development Environment:

Install necessary development tools (e.g., a code editor like VS Code).
Create Initial Files:

index.html (main HTML file)
styles.css (CSS for styling)
script.js (JavaScript file for functionality)
.gitignore (to ignore unnecessary files)
### Day 2: Basic HTML Structure
Tasks:
Create HTML Boilerplate:

Set up the basic HTML structure with <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
Add Calculator Layout:

Create the structure for the calculator including display and buttons for digits and operations.
Example Layout:
Display area for the result
Buttons for digits (0-9)
Buttons for operations (+, -, *, /)
Button for clear (C)
Button for equals (=)
### Day 3: Basic CSS Styling
Tasks:
Style the Calculator Layout:

Use CSS to style the calculator for better appearance.
Ensure Responsive Design:

Make sure the calculator looks good on different screen sizes.
Styling Tips:
Center the calculator on the page
Style the buttons with a uniform size and margin
Use different colors for digits, operations, and functional buttons (clear, equals)
### Day 4: Basic JavaScript Functions
Tasks:
Implement Basic Calculator Functions:

Write JavaScript functions to handle button clicks and update the display.
Handle Number Input:

Capture and display the numbers clicked by the user.
Functionalities:
Click a number button to display it
Concatenate numbers for multi-digit inputs
### Day 5: Implement Arithmetic Operations
Tasks:
Add Functions for Operations:

Write JavaScript functions to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Update Display with Results:

Show the result of the calculation when the equals button is pressed.
Functionalities:
Capture the operation button click
Perform the operation on the current and previous number
Display the result
### Day 6: Advanced Functionalities and Error Handling
Tasks:
Implement Clear Functionality:

Write a function to clear the display when the clear button is pressed.
Handle Edge Cases:

Ensure proper handling of division by zero and other potential errors.
Functionalities:
Clear the display
Display error messages for invalid operations
### Day 7: Final Testing and Documentation
Tasks:
Test All Functionalities:

Thoroughly test the calculator to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
Document the Project:

Update the README.md with usage instructions and details about the project.
## Conclusion
By following this day-by-day plan, you will develop a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, complete with styling, functionality, and error handling.
